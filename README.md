# vagrant-docker-swarm-project
In this project challenge we create an on premisses Docker Swarm cluster, using virtual machines provisioned with Vagrant.

Step by step:

<p>. Create a vagrantfile with the definitions of 3 virtual machines: being the first machine with the name of master and the other ones with the name of node01 and node02;</p>
<p>. Each virtual machine must have a fixed IP;</p>
<p>. All VMs must have Docker pre-installed;</p>
<p>. The machine named master must be the cluster manager node;</p>
<p>. The other machine must be added to the Swarm cluster as Workers.</p>
